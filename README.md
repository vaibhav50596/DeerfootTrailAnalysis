# Deerfoot Trail Analysis using Spark and Linear Regression (PySpark MLlib)

## Project Abstract

The Deerfoot Trail commute analysis project involves the calculation of commute time
statistics along with the prediction of commute times given a set number of inputs. This
project will also determine how accurate a machine learning model is in predicting commute
times given these inputs. The analysis is interesting since it uses readily-available public data
to provide predictions that could potentially benefit a large number of people. While the
analysis focuses on a fixed time period for one specific roadway, it could potentially be
expanded to predict commute times for major roadways across the country in real-time.
Besides providing the project team with an opportunity to learn and apply Spark concepts,
the results of the project could have real-world applications in transportation forecasting,
planning, and safety.
